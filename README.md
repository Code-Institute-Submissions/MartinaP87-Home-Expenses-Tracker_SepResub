# Home Expenses Tracker
[View the live project here](https://home-expenses-tracker87.herokuapp.com/)

Home Expenses Tracker is a command-line application that allows to set budgets and input basic home expenses such as bills, food, and car expenses throughout the year.
The application calculates the totals and compares them to budgets when set by the user or calculable.
The program's goal is to provide the user with an immediate understanding of essentials spendings and eventually to help better manage one's finances.
Home Expenses Tracker's target is young adults who just moved out from their parent's house and need to plan and manage their finances.
It also targets families with low incomes, who need to pay attention to any expense to stay within their budgets.

### Validator Testing:
- PEP8 
No errors were returned when passing through the official [PEP8 validator]();

## Bugs:
The initial idea was to create a worksheet for every expense.
When looping through the values of numerous worksheets, the program would have raised a 429 "Too many requests" error.
Reducing the number of worksheets fixed the problem.

When calculating the monthly bill totals, if there was an empty cell in the column, the program would have raised an int() error since "" can't be converted into an integer. 
Fill up all cells with 0 values temporarily fixed the error.
Adding a ternary operator in the function to convert to 0 all empty strings fixed the problem.
